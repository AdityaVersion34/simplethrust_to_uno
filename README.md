# SimpleThrust Sketch to Arduino Uno
This project aims to rewrite the SimpleThrust Arduino Mega sketch file to make it compatible with an Arduino Uno. It also fixes and combines this with an existing sketch used to produce a digital scale (force sensor) from a load cell and an LCD.

The SimpleThrust software itself, and relevant details about the serial output protocol can be found in the SimpleThrust documentation:

Only the force-sensing portion of the SimpleThrust serial output has been added to this sketch so far.
